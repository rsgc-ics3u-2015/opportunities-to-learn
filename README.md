# Gr. 11 – Intro to Computer Science

## Opportunities to Learn

Below are several streams that are available for you to learn from.

The number of streams will increase substantially in the coming weeks.  The depth, or layers of each stream, will deepen.

Choose a stream that suits your current level of comfort with **programming concepts** like control structures and data structures, or with Swift syntax, and dive in.

When have an idea that you think you'd like to run with, and you feel that you are ready, dive in and [start creating a product](https://haiku.rsgc.on.ca/c/5588506/file/show/70061518).

Note that from time to time this year, to ensure you have a solid foundation in programming terms and concepts, you will be asked to complete formative and summative mini-assessments. However, the bulk of your grade in this course is derived from your project-based work.

### Markov Bot

The [sequence for this stream](https://haiku.rsgc.on.ca/rgordon/2015cs11/cms_page/view/23686730) is described on Haiku.

### Arduino to Swift – Serial Interface

Swift can be used to interface with an Arduino device over a serial port connection.

Output from sensors on Arduino devices can then be visualized in a Swift Playground.

[Integer Blink](https://github.com/rgordonatrsgc/IntegerBlink)
Fork and clone this repository. A simple Arduino program – recommend you load this on your Arduino device to test the files provided below.

[swift-serial](https://github.com/rgordonatrsgc/swift-serial)
Fork and clone this repository. This program monitors the serial port and writes output to a file that can be read by the companion Playground file. Be sure to read the comments in the **main.swift** file and adjust the name of the serial device that is being monitored. **Important**: Open this project by double-clicking the *xcworkspace* file.

[ReadingRedirectedSerialOutputFromSharedDataFolder](https://github.com/rgordonatrsgc/ReadingRedirectedSerialOutputFromSharedDataFolder)
Fork and clone this repository. Load an Arduino program that provides output on the serial port. Open the swift-serial project. Open this Playground file. Run the swift-serial project. Then run this Playground file. 

### Swift Language Basics

Download and follow the steps provided in [this tutorial application](https://www.weheartswift.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Exercise-Platform-Demo.zip). I am looking for feedback on this program - should I purchase access to the additional chapters?
